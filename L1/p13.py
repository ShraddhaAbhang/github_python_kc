# Simple and Easy:
# Programs in python are written in English like statments which implies more clarity and a compact code.

# Procedure and Object Oriented:
# Python programs can be created using funtions and also using classes and object

# Dynamically Types:
# Python as assignment binds a name to an object meaning no data type to be specified

# Interpreted:
# Python code is traslated into byte code and then the byte code is interpreted by Python virtual Machine (PVM)

#Platform Independent and Portable:
# Python's compiler generate byte code which can be run on any system having PVM

# Huge Library:
# Python has huge library for developing programs faster --> GUI Tkinter, Django, PlotLib, NLTK, Biopython, Pygame, Numpy


# if line has one stmt then ; is optional
# if line has more than one stmt then ; is compulsary

Recap:

    Intro:
        - Guido Van Rossum
        - 1991,Feb
        - Free, Python 3.x ==> 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 --> version numbers --> django --> machine learning
        - Python Software Foundation(PSF) --> donation
        - Simple
        - Easy
        - POP 
        - Dynamically Types
        - Interpreted
        - Platform Independent
        - Huge Library --> readymade progrmas

    Coding:
        - print() --> to display the output on the screen, monitor
        - input() --> to accept the input from user via Keyboard 
        - int() --> convert input into integer
        - float() --> convert input into float
